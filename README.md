# babelify-slowdown
An example of babelify slowing down over time.

## How to reproduce slowdown

### Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/synthecypher/babelify-slowdown
cd babelify-slowdown
npm install
npm start
```

### Edit

If you edit either `index.js` or `bug.js` or even just save the file without making changes you'll see that the time it takes to build the `bundle.js` gradually takes longer and longer.

#### Output
```bash
> npm start

> babelify-slowdown@1.0.0 start /Users/synthecypher/Projects/babelify-slowdown
> gulp
